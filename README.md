# Block Blizzard Chat Channels

An addon for World of Warcraft - The War Within, Cataclysm Classic and Classic Era!

## About
This addon allows you to block several Blizzard-run chat channels in game across your entire account.

It allows you prevent all of your characters from joining any (or all) of the following Channels:

* General Chat
* Trade Chat
* Services Chat (Retail Only)
* LocalDefense Chat
* WorldDefense Chat (Classic/Era Only)
* LookingForGroup Chat


## Compatibility
* **The War Within** - 11.0.0
* **Cataclysm Classic** - 4.4.0
* **Classic Era** - 1.15.3


## Configuration
By default, no chat channels are blocked, and you'll need to configure the addon to block only the channels you do not want to see.

You can configure the addon by typing `/blockchatchannels` into chat, or from the 'Block Blizzard Chat Channels' section of the Game Options.

Ticking a box will take effect immediately, and will affect all of your characters account wide.

You can click the 'Rejoin' button to make your current character join all of the channels that you have not blocked.
